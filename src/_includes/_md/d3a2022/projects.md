    \+ P1 — Exhibition {.proj__btn}
::: .proj__detail {hidden=""}
::: .detail
Galleries and museums are increasingly showcasing digital works, ranging from immersive installations, large-scale projections, interactive pieces on a browser, and more. Following the theme "The Art of the Everyday: Ordinary Extraordinary", create a digital work that focuses on scale or interactivity. The project will be realized in the context of the undergraduate art open exhibition in the Mason Gross Galleries. The final form of this project is limited to a 2D animation or a screen-based interactive piece on a browser.

Throughout this project, we will question:
- — what are ways of displaying digital work in a gallery space?
- — what are novel forms of interactivity?
- — how does scale, audience, and duration affect digital works?
:::
::: .Task
Create a digital animation that is intended for a large-scale wall projection or a browser-based interactive work that follows the theme "The Art of the Everyday: Ordinary Extraordinary".

\+ P2 — Subcultural Publication {.proj__btn}
::: .proj__detail {hidden=""}
::: .detail
The theorist Michael Warner argues that publications are the site where publics are formed. We will look at the evolution of printing, from its origins in Korean Buddhism then Gutenberg; mass versus subcultural publishing; translation of print to screen; born-digital publishing. Within this timeline, we will study when subcultures and their practice of publishing within specific means. Examples include Maximum Rock and Roll, New Woman’s Survival Catalog, and Genderfail. For this project, you will focus on (1) the study of a subculture and (2) the display of the publication. Consider alternative forms of digital publishing, ephemerality, file structure poetry, screenshot archives, etc.

Throughout this project, we will question:
- — How has publishing evolved?
- — What are alternative forms of publishing?
- — How do constraints affect publishing?
:::
::: .Task
Design and build a responsive, cross platform publication for a specific subculture.

\+ P3 — Social Web {.proj__btn}
::: .proj__detail {hidden=""}
::: .detail
How would you describe a social network? This project will reconsider the social interactions we currently make through online platforms. Let’s build trust, intimacy, and novelty into our digital experiences. There are multiple ways to consider this. We will start with a critical overview of social media. Who created these platforms and what “problems” do they solve? What behaviors do they promote? How does the platform present itself? We’ve all heard the acronym IRL, but Gen Z and Millennials understand the increasing blurriness of IRL vs. URL. Alternative forms of networks, interfaces, and platforms will be introduced, such as p2p, sneakernets, blogchains, analog hypertext, etc. We will focus on locality, messaging, and slow reading.

In the essay Learning Trails, Leo Shaw writes, “Given the sheer volume of content that fills digital spaces, we might think about attention using metaphors of environmental stewardship: building trails, remediating damaged landscapes, prescribing burns, packing out our trash.” By thinking through analog and digital forms of hypertext, we can design new methods of reading and interacting online.
:::
::: .Task
Create a social network that uses the phone as the primary entry point. This does not have to be a mobile application, and should consider how networks are created outside of devices. You can use a prototyping tool (like Figma) or build a responsive website.
